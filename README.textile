h2. ScalaTalk -- code samples from a talk I gave at Silicon Valley Code Camp in 2011:
http://prezi.com/ewvgkgw5pgim/scala-for-java-programmers/


h2. To run

First get sbt 0.11.0
from https://github.com/harrah/xsbt

Follow the instructions for creating the sbt runner script:
https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Setup

sbt

h2. Setting up IntelliJ

First create a file called ~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt
with:
resolvers += "sbt-idea-repo" at "http://mpeltonen.github.com/maven/"

addSbtPlugin("com.github.mpeltonen" % "sbt-idea" % "0.11.0")

h2. Playing with the examples

Once you're in sbt, you can do:
> gen-idea

this will generate the .idea files and you can then open the project in IntelliJ.
If you have the sbt plugin in IntelliJ, you can just click the green play button
to start up sbt in IntelliJ.


h2. Playing with the Examples

> compile

You can also then directly run any of the java or scala examples
by starting up the console:

> console
scala> import com.dragade.svcc._
scala> ClosureEx.main(null)
Fruit grape Score is 5
Fruit orange Score is 6
Fruit apple Score is 8
Fruit cherry Score is 9

scala>
